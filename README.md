# CargasCustomerFunctionButton
Adds a programmable button the the Cargas Energy Customer Accounts page.
This code creates a Chrome Extension that adds functionality to the Cargas Energy website. Currently it adds one button to the Customer Accounts screen that will trigger a programmable webhook.

Before compiling and deploying, you will need to edit fields in "index.js" WEB_URL_HERE for your webhook URL

And in the "manifest.json" you will need to input the active URLs that the script will run on.

Work in Progress.
